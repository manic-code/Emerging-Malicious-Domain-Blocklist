# Info
This blocklist is intended to supplement existing/larger blocklist sources. The list provides the most coverage on websites such as those that offer free movie streaming (**ex. soap2day/fmovies.to**) or other similar seedy and untrustworthy domains. All additions to this blocklist are vetted to avoid including a false positive. While not intended to be used for anti-tracking purposes such domains may be included if they do not break any legitimate services when blocked.
> Here is the raw URL for the list, add this to your pihole or other dns filter.

# Additional Notes
This list is one of many upstream sources for [Hagezi's Blocklist](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists), if you currently use the **PRO**, **PRO++**, or **Ultimate** version of Hagezi's list there's no additional benefit to adding this list as you are already protected by this source.

# Suggestions or Issues?
All submissions are welcome in the issues section, please ensure it does not break any legitimate services before submission. Newly registered domains that appear highly suspicious and have little history on VirusTotal.com are also eligible to be included in this list. 
> Please verify that new URL submissions do not already exist on [Hagezi's blocklist](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists). You can use [this website to search multiple blocklists for matches.](https://dnswarden.com/search.html)
